# Commit Guidelines
For professional purposes, we ask that every commit you make follows as closely to the following as possible.

### Commit Messages
Commit titles should be 50 characters or less but including the most relevant information. Additional information can be put in the body in the form of bullet points. Most importantly, be sure to write in the present tense.

Example:
```

```

### Commit Tags
The following terms should be the very first part of every commit title. Example: `chore: update package)
- `chore` - configuration change (e.g. .gitignore/packages/version)
- `feat` - a new feature in production
- `fix` - fixed a bug/problem that produced unwanted results
- `style` - formatting and syntax (indents, semicolons, strings)
- `refactor` - modifying existing code (e.g renaming varialbes or moving files)
- `typings` - any types related changes

### Commit Scopes
Scopes are optionally put after a commit tag. Example: `feat(api): add 2fa endpoint`

**Common Scopes**
- `api` - website api
- `client` - user-run application
- `db` - data/database
- `docs` - documentation
